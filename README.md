# Test Smells -- An Annotated Bibliography 

## Context
The study group XX is aimed at software engineers who want to understand the challenges of working with software testing.  With an interest primarily on test smells, we select a collection of papers on the field and discuss them during weekly meetings. In an effort to help the community we are sharing here a list of papers with some interesting and useful notes. 

For researchers or others interested in this topic, we share a <a href="https://github.com/luana-martins/study-group/blob/master/Schedule.md"> schedule </a> of discussions planned by semester, come and join us! 
Meetings on Wednesdays, at 3 p.m. (BSB) - Link?
